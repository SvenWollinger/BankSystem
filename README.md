# BankSystem
A client side only bank system written for my Apprentinceship.

It saves the password hashed in a hopefully safe way.

Please do not use my implementation here for anything serious though :^).

# Building
To build this simply run gradle build, it will output the jar to /builds/libs/BankSystem.jar.

# Running
This application runs purely in the Windows command prompt.
